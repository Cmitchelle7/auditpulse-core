# auditpulse-core

Lightweight static analysis security scanner for Soroban (Stellar) smart contracts written in Rust. Function structure (names, boundaries, source locations) is derived from Tree-sitter Rust parsing; the checks themselves are conservative source-text heuristics.

## Checks

* **`missingRequireAuth`** (`AP-AUTH-001`): Flags authorization-sensitive operations (token transfers, balance updates, ledger writes) inside functions that omit `env.require_auth()`.
* **`unwrapUsage`** (`AP-ERROR-001`): Detects explicit `.unwrap()`, `.expect()`, or `panic!()` calls that cause runtime panics; encourages returning `Result<_, ContractError>`.
* **`missingExtendTtl`** (`AP-STORAGE-001`): Identifies persistent or temporary ledger storage access that lacks an accompanying `.extend_ttl()` call, preventing silent data expiry.
* **`uncheckedArithmetic`** (`AP-ARITH-001`): Flags add/subtract/multiply/divide on amount-like values (amounts, balances, supplies, fees) with no checked math (`checked_add`, `saturating_sub`, bounds) that can overflow, underflow, or divide by zero.
* **`unvalidatedExternalCall`** (`AP-CALL-001`): Flags cross-contract/token operations (transfers, burns, mints, admin changes) performed with no `require_auth` and no validated address argument.
* **`unprotectedUpgrade`** (`AP-UPG-001`): Flags upgrade/migration/admin-configuration functions (recognized by name) that contain no `require_auth` or admin check.
* **`debugStatements`** (`AP-DEBUG-001`): Flags debug/development-only macros (`log!`, `dbg!`, `println!`, `print!`, `eprint(ln)!`) left in production contract code.

### Severity and confidence

Severity expresses potential impact; confidence expresses how likely the
detected pattern is actually problematic. The two are independent:

| Rule | Severity | Confidence |
|------|----------|------------|
| `AP-AUTH-001` | critical | high |
| `AP-ERROR-001` | high | high |
| `AP-STORAGE-001` | high | medium |
| `AP-ARITH-001` | medium | medium |
| `AP-CALL-001` | high | low |
| `AP-UPG-001` | critical | medium |
| `AP-DEBUG-001` | low | high |

### Fixtures

`fixtures/` holds small Rust examples used by the regression suite
(`tests/fixtures.test.ts`):

```
fixtures/
  vulnerable/    # each file triggers at least one rule
  safe/          # each file must produce zero findings
  edge-cases/    # comments/strings, odd formatting, nested blocks, structural braces, coexisting findings
  workspaces/    # multi-module examples (per-file scanning semantics)
```

### Rust parsing (structural analysis)

AuditPulse parses each Rust file once with Tree-sitter (`tree-sitter-rust`) to
extract function declarations: name, start/end line, and body boundaries.
Rules that analyze functions receive this AST-derived structure, so locations
stay exact even when comments or string literals contain braces. The parser is
isolated in `src/parser/rust.ts`: if the native module cannot load, or a file
has syntax errors that prevent reliable extraction, scanning falls back to the
original source-text extraction and continues without losing findings. This is
structural parsing only — AuditPulse does not perform Rust type analysis,
semantic analysis, or cross-file dataflow.

### Limitations

Function structure comes from Tree-sitter parsing (see above); the checks
remain conservative source-text heuristics over those function bodies. There
is **no** Rust semantic or type analysis, no compiler-equivalent analysis, and
never any cross-file dataflow. Known consequences:

* `AP-ARITH-001` evaluates arithmetic line-by-line; checked math in a helper
  called from another line is not connected, and complex expression chains may
  be missed. It prefers silence over noise.
* `AP-CALL-001` accepts a `*_id` argument name or a `require_auth` call as a
  validation boundary; it does not verify the address is actually checked.
* `AP-UPG-001` recognizes admin/upgrade functions by name, so unusual naming
  can evade it.
* Directory scans evaluate each Rust file independently; there is no
  cross-file dataflow analysis.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emmanuel-Ugochukwu1/auditpulse-core.git
cd auditpulse-core
npm install
npm run build

# Optional: put the `auditpulse` command on your PATH
npm link
```

## Quickstart

One copy-paste example, from install to report:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
node dist/index.js scan examples/vulnerable_vault.rs            # human report, exit 1
node dist/index.js scan examples/safe_vault.rs                  # no findings, exit 0
node dist/index.js scan examples --format json > report.json    # machine-readable
```

The `examples/` directory contains two small Soroban-style demo contracts:

| File | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| `examples/vulnerable_vault.rs` | Deliberately vulnerable: trips most rules (missing auth, unchecked math, unvalidated external call, unprotected admin, panics, debug macros) |
| `examples/safe_vault.rs` | Clean reference: authorized, checked, TTL-extended — produces zero findings |

## CLI

The package ships a small dependency-free CLI:

```text
auditpulse scan <path>        Scan a Rust file or a directory tree
auditpulse report <path>      Scan and print the human-readable report
auditpulse sarif <path>       Scan and print SARIF 2.1.0 output
auditpulse init               Write a starter auditpulse.toml
auditpulse help               Show help
```

Options:

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `--format human\|json\|sarif` | Output format for `scan` (default: human) |
| `--min-severity <level>` | Drop findings below `low`/`medium`/`high`/`critical` |
| `--config <file>` | Explicit config file (default: nearest `auditpulse.toml`, else defaults) |

### Scanning

Give `scan` a single `.rs` file or a directory. Directories are walked
recursively for Rust files, skipping `node_modules`, `dist`, `target`, `.git`
and similar generated/unrelated directories, plus anything listed under
`exclude` in the configuration. Files are visited in deterministic (sorted)
order and each file is scanned independently; there is no cross-file
dataflow. Findings always identify their file and line; column and function
details appear only when the rule can compute them reliably.

### JSON output

```bash
node dist/index.js scan contracts/SampleVault.rs --format json
```

```json
{
  "tool": { "name": "auditpulse", "version": "2.0.0" },
  "summary": {
    "filesScanned": 1,
    "findingCount": 3,
    "bySeverity": { "critical": 1, "high": 2 }
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "ruleId": "AP-AUTH-001",
      "severity": "critical",
      "message": "Authorization-sensitive operations in function 'withdraw' ...",
      "location": {
        "file": "contracts/SampleVault.rs",
        "line": 23,
        "function": "withdraw"
      },
      "confidence": "high",
      "remediation": "Add env.require_auth(&account) ..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Optional fields (`confidence`, `remediation`, `column`, `function`) are
omitted when the rule does not provide them.

### SARIF output

```bash
node dist/index.js sarif contracts/SampleVault.rs > auditpulse.sarif
```

Emits SARIF 2.1.0 with the tool driver, rule metadata (ids, descriptions,
levels) and one result per finding with file URI and start line, ready for
upload to GitHub Code Scanning.

## Configuration

An optional `auditpulse.toml` is discovered in the scan target's directory or
any parent, or can be given explicitly with `--config`:

```toml
disabled_rules = ["AP-DEBUG-001"]
min_severity = "low"          # low | medium | high | critical
exclude = ["vendor", "generated"]
```

Without a config file, defaults apply: all rules enabled, `min_severity =
"low"`, no extra exclusions. Invalid values are rejected with exit code 2.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | No findings at or above the configured threshold |
| `1` | Findings at or above the threshold |
| `2` | Usage, configuration, or input error |

The same semantics apply in `--format json` and `sarif` modes, so CI pipelines
can rely on the exit code regardless of the chosen output format.

## Web Demo

A minimal local web demo puts a dashboard on top of the same scanner the CLI uses — no new dependencies, just Node's built-in `http` module.

```bash
npm install && npm run build
npm run dev:web          # serves the API + dashboard on http://127.0.0.1:4646
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:4646** and:

1. Click **Load safe example** → **Run scan** → "No findings" (clean result state).
2. Click **Load vulnerable example** → **Run scan** → multiple findings, each with rule ID, severity, confidence, message, location and remediation guidance.

The **Run scan** button `POST`s the editor contents to the API and renders the JSON report. You can also paste any Rust source directly into the editor.

### API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/health` | Liveness probe: `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `POST /api/scan` | Scan in-memory source: `{"source": "<rust source>"}` → full JSON report (same model as `scan --format json`) |
| `GET /api/examples/safe` | Load `examples/safe_vault.rs` |
| `GET /api/examples/vulnerable` | Load `examples/vulnerable_vault.rs` |

```bash
# Scan a contract through the API
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4646/api/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"source\": \"pub fn f(env: Env) { let x = a + b; }\"}"
```

Notes:

* Submitted source is analyzed **in memory** by the same rules the CLI uses (Tree-sitter function structure plus source-text heuristics) and is never executed or written to disk.
* Request bodies are capped (256 KB) and invalid input returns a JSON error with a 4xx status.
* Function structure comes from Tree-sitter Rust parsing; the checks are source-text heuristics, not semantic analysis, and there is no cross-file dataflow. See [Limitations](#limitations).

## CI / GitHub Actions

The repository ships a minimal workflow at
`.github/workflows/auditpulse.yml`. It installs dependencies, builds the CLI,
scans the configured target, uploads SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning, and fails
the job when findings exist at or above the configured threshold.

To use it in your own repository, copy the workflow and point its target at
your contract sources:

```yaml
env:
  SCAN_TARGET: path/to/contracts   # scanned and uploaded as SARIF
  GATE_TARGET: path/to/contracts   # exit code gates the job (usually the same path)
```

The job needs `security-events: write` permission for the SARIF upload;
results then appear under the repository's **Code scanning** tab.

A minimal non-GitHub CI invocation relies on exit codes alone:

```bash
node dist/index.js scan contracts/ || echo "findings above threshold"
```
